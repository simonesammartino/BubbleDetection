This is a simple MATLAB algorithm to detect bubbles generated on the surface of a small pond.
Bubbles size and production flux is plotted in real time in the graphical interface of the code.

The code can be run simply by typing bubbledect in MATLAB.
Be sure to place the Test.mp4 footage test file in the same directory of the bubbledetect.m file.
